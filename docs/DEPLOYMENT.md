# Production deployment

The visualization is a stateless site deployed through the reusable q5m node
hosting contract in [`q5m-ai/homelab`](https://github.com/q5m-ai/homelab/issues/18).
This repository owns the image, Compose metadata, health check, and trusted
release workflow. The homelab repository owns runner installation, node policy,
activation/rollback, reboot recovery, and Docker ingress enforcement.

## YAML ownership cutover: prepared, not activated

This change follows homelab's current
[production-adoption contract](https://github.com/q5m-ai/homelab/blob/main/node/PRODUCTION-ADOPTION.md).
The operator confirmed q5m-lab 1.6.2 and generic production capability installed
on all four nodes, with disposable adoption, healthy deploy, failure, rollback
and recovery acceptance complete. Erdős needs no separate registration or
hand-written binding: its committed project declaration owns the intent.

**Before merging:** confirm the production runner is still online and idle, let
any active legacy deployment finish, and make no further legacy dispatch. Then
merge in one coordinated window with the existing workflow enabled. The first
trusted `main` job runs `plan`, then `deploy --adopt-existing`; adoption and the
new release occur under one guarded lifecycle lock. Matching repeated adoption
is harmless, while conflicting ownership fails closed.

The first deploy preserves service `erdos-193`, n03 placement, the Nginx/Compose
runtime, fixed port `8193`, `erdos-193.q5m.ai` tunnel, active/rollback history and
boot recovery. It neither migrates hosts nor creates a route. Before merging,
report the verified target and checks and obtain explicit go-ahead. After merge,
verify the public release marker equals the deployed commit and test the complete
site. A failed public check may follow successful local activation: retain and
inspect the exact operation receipt before retrying or requesting rollback.

## Placement and routes

**Verified September 8, 2026 before editing:** `q5m-n03`, service `erdos-193`,
active release `61d8c9fc7b2b9006cf0fc7995eb19fb0c69e18e6`, rollback release
`92374aa7aec22af88f55e7d1becffc00b946e61f`, and Nginx listening on fixed port
`8193`. Repository runner `erdos-193-n03` was online and idle with label
`erdos-193-deploy`; the old n01 runner was offline. Public
`https://erdos-193.q5m.ai/.q5m-release` returned the same active SHA through
Cloudflare and the root returned HTTP 200. The production plan must recheck these
facts and preserved tunnel ownership under lock before any mutation.

The cutover details below are historical evidence, not current placement.

Retired origin (verified 2026-08-21):

- host: `q5m-dev`;
- retained checkout: `/Users/erik/code/erdos-193`;
- former process: PM2 `math193-viz`, Python `http.server` on port `8193`;
- retirement result: process deleted, saved PM2 startup state updated, and the
  old port stopped after explicit approval. The checkout and logs were retained.

Historical placement (verified 2026-08-21):

- node: `q5m-n02.localdomain` (current NPM-reachable address `10.1.1.31`);
- app: `erdos-193`;
- repository-scoped runner: `erdos-193-n02`;
- runner label: `erdos-193-deploy`;
- Docker-published port: `8193`, admitted only from Nginx Proxy Manager;
- local release identity: `http://127.0.0.1:8193/.q5m-release` on the node.

Nginx Proxy Manager terminates public TLS. Proxy host ID `20` serves the
canonical `erdos-193.q5m.ai` route from `10.1.1.31:8193`. Deprecated NPM proxy
hosts `14` (`erdos-193.q5m.io`) and `19` (`erdos.q5m.io`) were deleted by
explicit operator request after cutover. Their remaining Cloudflare DNS cleanup,
the proposed `erdos.q5m.ai` hostname, certificate/canonical changes, and redirect
decision remain owned by issue #12.

The old PM2 origin was retained through cutover, public reversal, reboot proof,
and stabilization, then retired after explicit approval. Local image/state
rollback on `q5m-n02` is now the application rollback path; the old Mac is no
longer a live origin.

## Verified acceptance evidence

The initial production cutover used exact merged commit
`a68aa2276213112b94eaf6473a27dae835086c97`. GitHub Actions run
[`32443889384`](https://github.com/q5m-ai/erdos-193/actions/runs/32443889384)
passed the hosted image gate and then deployed that exact commit on
`erdos-193-n02`. Pull request run `32443847484` passed the hosted gate while the
self-hosted deploy job was skipped.

Additional checks completed 2026-08-21:

- an intentionally unhealthy candidate `8d4fcbc64f34` failed Compose health and
  automatically restored healthy bootstrap release `02003133d4df`;
- a healthy local rollback round trip selected `02003133d4df`, then restored
  merged release `a68aa2276213`, with both health gates passing;
- after the supervised `q5m-n02` reboot at `14:37Z`, systemd recreated the exact
  merged release without a manual container start; the app was healthy by
  `14:37:51Z`, and the repository runner was online/listening by `14:37:45Z`;
- NPM reached `/.q5m-release` from its approved source while an ordinary client
  timed out against direct port `8193` before and after reboot;
- canonical public cutover returned the exact commit and all documented site
  paths returned `200`; NPM then reversed to `10.1.1.211` (root `200`, release
  marker `404`) and returned to `10.1.1.31`, where exact-release proof passed;
- `main` now requires the hosted `Container contract` check, up-to-date pull
  request branches, conversation resolution, and no force-push/deletion; the
  `production` Environment admits only `main`;
- after operator approval, PM2 `math193-viz` was removed from the running and
  saved process lists on `q5m-dev`; port `8193` stopped while the canonical
  public exact release and all documented paths continued to pass.

Every later trusted `main` push deploys and reports its own exact merge commit,
so use the current owner's status and the public `/.q5m-release` response for
current identity rather than treating the initial cutover SHA as a floating
version. After adoption, status is `q5m-lab project production status --service erdos-193
--json`; do not invoke legacy mutating status.

## Release path

`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` validates image build/runtime on a
GitHub-hosted runner for pull requests, trusted `main` pushes, and manual
dispatches. Its deployment job can target the self-hosted runner only for a
push or dispatch whose ref is exactly `main`. The workflow has read-only
repository permissions, production concurrency, a protected Environment hook,
and a repository/branch/event guard. Pull-request code never reaches the
self-hosted runner.

The workflow checks out exact `GITHUB_SHA` with full reachable history and
without retaining GitHub credentials. The production source policy rejects a
shallow checkout or a source outside `/home/q5m`. Because this legacy runner's
Actions workspace is under `/opt/q5m`, the workflow first requires the existing
q5m-owned `/home/q5m/code/erdos-193` checkout to be clean, refreshes only its
canonical HTTPS `main` ref, and detaches it at the exact SHA. Any dirty checkout,
remote mismatch, or SHA mismatch fails before plan. From that canonical source
it uses the YAML production entry point (not a validation shim
followed by an independent legacy deployment):

```sh
q5m-lab project production plan --revision "$GITHUB_SHA" --json
q5m-lab project production deploy --revision "$GITHUB_SHA" --adopt-existing --json
q5m-lab project production status --service erdos-193 --json
```

Plan failure prevents deploy. The project declaration selects and enforces the
exact source, n03 host, existing hostname/tunnel, release-marker health and
rollback contract. `--adopt-existing` explicitly transfers the matching legacy
owner during this first deploy; it cannot overwrite a conflicting owner. No node
override, missing-tool fallback, or direct `q5m-app` writer is permitted. Status is read-only and runs even after failure;
it is not recovery. Local activation can succeed before public verification
fails, so a failed job must not be described as automatic rollback.

The node archives that exact commit, validates `q5m/app.env` and
`q5m/compose.yaml`, builds `q5m/erdos-193:<full-commit>`, waits for container
health, and changes boot state only after success. The previous healthy release
is retained for local rollback.

The image serves committed `viz/` and `results/` assets (the latter at `/family/`),
subject to `.dockerignore`. The optional `build/q5m-site` review output and LAN
server are not production inputs. The deployment serves the complete committed site: `viz/` at `/` and `results/`
at `/family/`.

`q5m.yaml` declares n03 and `erdos-193.q5m.ai` as project-owned production intent,
and uses the Compose release's health path `/.q5m-release`. Its `development` and `build` sections remain
separate; production never starts `q5m/serve_site.py` or serves the review build.
The old isolated `project deploy --environment production` is not this interface
and must not be used to create another owner. The first authorized merge-triggered deploy adopts matching existing ownership;
subsequent trusted `main` pushes activate releases after the container gate. The
application workflow creates no DNS, tunnel, port or volume.

`/.q5m-release` reports the exact full commit built into the image; `/healthz` is the container health endpoint.
There are no application secrets or mutable volumes. The required empty
machine-local root is still created with standard metadata:

```sh
sudo install -d -o root -g q5m -m 0750 /etc/q5m/apps/erdos-193
```

## Release rollback after YAML adoption

Release rollback uses the same protected binding and preserved release history:

```sh
q5m-lab project production rollback --service erdos-193 --json
q5m-lab project production status --service erdos-193 --json
```

This selects an application release, not a previous infrastructure owner. A lost
client or public-health failure is not permission to resubmit: record the returned
operation unit and inspect that exact unit/journal and app state first. Recovery,
when explicitly approved, uses `q5m-lab project production recover --binding
erdos-193 --json`. Never bypass the writer fence with an old binary or Docker.

Undoing adoption is a separate operator-approved handoff: freeze the YAML writer,
review the binding installer's `plan-release`, and use `release-owner` with its
exact approved plan. Only afterward may legacy CI be re-enabled. This does not
choose a release, downgrade tools or delete the route. There is no generic
production down/purge operation in this contract.

## Historical operations (pre-adoption only)

The remaining commands record the earlier legacy lifecycle and migrations.
**Do not execute them against an adopted binding.** Current adoption, rollback,
recovery and ownership reversal follow the contract and sections above. Host
moves, reboot tests and retirement require their own explicit authorization.

### Bootstrap and normal operations

Follow `node/HOSTING.md` in the homelab repository to install `q5m-app`, the
firewall watcher, and a repository-scoped runner. Bootstrap the first release
from a trusted checkout before enabling reboot recovery:

```sh
release=$(git rev-parse refs/heads/main^{commit})
sudo -u q5m /usr/local/bin/q5m-app \
  deploy-checkout erdos-193 "$PWD" "$release"
sudo systemctl enable --now q5m-app@erdos-193.service
```

Normal releases are Actions-driven. Operator checks and local rollback are:

```sh
q5m-app status erdos-193
q5m-app rollback erdos-193
systemctl status q5m-app@erdos-193.service
q5m-runner status erdos-193-n02
```

A second `rollback` returns to the release that was active before the first
rollback, provided both health gates pass.

## Cutover and reversal

The completed migration used this sequence while PM2 `math193-viz` remained
available for controlled reversal:

1. Record the old NPM origin and both public response baselines.
2. Deploy exact `main` to `q5m-n02`; verify `q5m-app status` and that
   `/.q5m-release` equals the full release.
3. From NPM, verify `http://10.1.1.31:8193/healthz` and representative site
   assets. The NPM container does not currently resolve `.localdomain`, so use
   the recorded current placement address rather than silently assuming node
   DNS works there. From an ordinary LAN client, verify direct port `8193` is
   blocked.
4. Change only the NPM origin to `10.1.1.31:8193`; do not change DNS,
   hostnames, certificate, or canonical content in this step.
5. Verify `/`, `proof.html`, `learn.html`, `walk3d.html`, `progress.html`,
   `demo.html`, `erdos-193-gaussian-proof.pdf`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` over the
   canonical public hostname.
6. Reverse NPM to `q5m-dev:8193` once and repeat the baseline. Then return it to
   `q5m-n02:8193` and repeat the replacement checks.
7. Keep the old PM2 origin during stabilization. Remove it only after explicit
   approval and a final exact-release/public baseline.

That old-origin reversal path was retired on 2026-08-21. For a current
application failure, use the recorded local `q5m-app rollback erdos-193` state;
do not point NPM at the stopped Mac or repair a failure by deleting release
state.

## Failed candidate and reboot tests

Use a reviewed commit that intentionally fails its container health check,
then deploy it through the same interface. The command must fail and
`q5m-app status erdos-193` must still report the previous healthy commit. Revert
the test commit through Git; never edit a staged release in place.

After a healthy deployment and with public NPM still reversible, arrange a
supervised node reboot. After reconnecting:

```sh
systemctl is-active q5m-app@erdos-193.service
q5m-app status erdos-193
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8193/.q5m-release
```

No manual `docker start` is permitted.

## Moving to another standard node

Prepare the second node from the same homelab contract, create the empty
`/etc/q5m/apps/erdos-193` root, and install a repository runner with a unique
node-specific name but the same `erdos-193-deploy` label. Disable the old runner
before enabling the new one so a workflow cannot select placement
nondeterministically. Deploy the same full commit, verify NPM-only ingress, then
change and reverse the NPM origin exactly as above. No file in `q5m/` changes
for a move from `q5m-n02` to `q5m-n01`.

## Retirement

The old Mac origin was retired on 2026-08-21 after route reversal,
stabilization, and explicit approval:

```sh
pm2 delete math193-viz
pm2 save
```

Post-retirement verification found no running or saved `math193-viz`, no
listener on old port `8193`, an intact `/Users/erik/code/erdos-193` checkout,
and unchanged canonical exact-release/public health.

Future removal of the active node placement remains a separate operation:

1. remove runner `erdos-193-n02` with `sudo q5m-runner remove` and an expiring
   GitHub removal token;
2. disable `q5m-app@erdos-193`, remove its ingress declaration, and reload the
   q5m Docker firewall as documented in homelab `node/HOSTING.md`;
3. treat deletion of retained releases/images, the old checkout, or logs as a
   separate irreversible cleanup requiring explicit approval.
