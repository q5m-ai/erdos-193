# AI resume checkpoint: sharp basis dimension and 3D step count

**Snapshot: September 10, 2026. Status: research WIP, not a finished joint paper.**
Start here, then read only the linked material needed for the next task.

## 1. The target and the boundary

Determine the least dimension $d_*$ admitting an infinite positive
standard-basis walk with no three collinear vertices, together with the
minimum number $s_*$ of arbitrary integer step types for such a walk in 3D.
Prove infinite constructions and lower bounds applying to **every** walk in
the smaller classes. The [joint formulation](JOINT-MINIMUM.md) defines the
aggregate target, the implication matrix, and the open equality question.
The original [problem statement](PROBLEM.md) remains the canonical short
basis-only definition. Its correspondence assets still describe that problem,
not the entire joint formulation: the [monochrome PNG](unit-step-problem.png) and
[standalone raw LaTeX](unit-step-problem.tex). They are generated from the
statement by [render_problem.py](render_problem.py), using
`uv run --with matplotlib==3.10.6 python research/unit-step/render_problem.py`.

- **Proved:** $4\le d_*\le s_*$, by unavoidable ternary abelian squares and basis encoding.
- **Proposed upper bounds:** $d_*\le s_*\le6$, pending independent review of the
  existing six-step 3D / 6D draft. The construction is already found.
- **Open here:** exact $(d_*,s_*)$, including whether they coincide; no exact
  value is conjectured as fact.
- **Quantifier distinction:** $d_*$ is also the minimum step budget for
  arbitrarily long finite 3D examples whose menus may depend on length;
  $s_*$ requires one fixed menu for all lengths. The finite projection and
  compactness arguments are in the joint formulation, not a new threshold proof.
- **Already distinct and settled:** the original Erdős 193 construction allows
  an arbitrary finite step set in Z³, not only the three positive basis vectors.
  Its Lean theorem and site acceptance do not verify the follow-ups.

The desired research end state is a joint synthesis involving **Stijn Cambie,
Erik Kalviainen, and Jeffrey Shallit**, explaining the sharp threshold through
geometry and combinatorics. This is a proposed collaboration goal, not an agreed
new byline. Reconciliation and independent review come before journal packaging.
Do not hold the original result hostage to solving every extension.

Four-collinear constructions are secondary unless they clarify the common
mechanism or the 3D step-count/collinearity trade-off. The four-displacement
return draft would give $C_3(4)\le3$ if vetted, not triple avoidance.
Applications are optional research questions, not established
engineering consequences. Related exploration remains separate in
[PR #38](https://github.com/q5m-ai/erdos-193/pull/38) and
[PR #44](https://github.com/q5m-ai/erdos-193/pull/44); those titles are not evidence
of a validated application and those branches are not folded into this checkpoint.

## 2. Read the source manuscripts with attribution

The [manuscript archive](../../paper/followups/README.md) indexes all five core
PDFs, the available editable sources, and the explicit missing-source inventory.
The [artifact catalogue](artifacts.json) supplies checksums, statuses, and text
paths. Read the original PDF when extracted mathematical text is ambiguous.

| Stage | Credit | What it contributes |
|---|---|---|
| Original finite-step Z³ theorem | Cambie and Kalviainen | Gaussian/valuation foundation; original Lean proof. |
| 16D positive unit steps | Shallit | Basis encoding, explicit morphism, word equivalence, smaller candidates. |
| 14D simplification | Cambie | Offsets identifying two pairs of spatial steps. |
| Proposed 6D improvement | Kalviainen, using Cambie's offsets and Shallit's encoding | Alternating signed-Gaussian source restricts the transition menu. |
| Four-letter weak-abelian-cube draft | Supplied by Shallit, no PDF byline; reported AI-generated | Ternary valuation and return blocks; forbids four, not three, collinear vertices after basis encoding. |

Human responsibility and source-reported AI assistance are documented per
manuscript. Do not silently assign all documents to all three people or rewrite
the original paper's Cambie–Kalviainen citation.

## 3. Proof/evidence ledger

| Claim | Actual evidence and limit |
|---|---|
| Original Erdős 193 negative answer | [Paper/source](../../paper/erdos193.tex), [Lean package](../../formal/Hilbert193/README.md), [site acceptance](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/193/proof-claims#proof-claim-239). Applies to arbitrary finite step sets. |
| Three positive directions cannot suffice | [Short extension-tree certificate and independent exhaustive check](../../design/UNIT-STEP-4D-5D-INVESTIGATION.md#1-why-three-positive-coordinate-directions-cannot-work): every ternary eight-letter word contains an ordinary abelian square. This finite exhaustive obstruction proves an infinite impossibility. |
| A six-step 3D construction and its six-coordinate basis encoding | [Two-page draft](../../paper/unit_step_walk_N6_short.pdf), [source](../../paper/unit_step_walk_N6_short.tex), [scheme notes](../../design/SIGNED-GAUSSIAN-UNIT-STEP-OPTIMIZATION.md). Exact written argument, independent review pending, not Lean-formalized. |
| Six is optimal in the stated tagging scheme | Analytic argument in the [scheme notes](../../design/SIGNED-GAUSSIAN-UNIT-STEP-OPTIMIZATION.md#optimality-inside-this-tag-scheme). The new [arbitrary-tag classification](explorations/gaussian-tags.md) extends this to arbitrary scales, state tags, and sign streams preserving the specified all-pairs valuation certificate (with constant offset); AI-reviewed, not human-certified. Neither is a global lower bound. |
| Subsampling the existing walk cannot beat six with eventual gaps at most 16 | [Return-block report and independent checkers](explorations/return-blocks.md): exhaustive finite obstruction plus substitution recurrence; all 1,048,575 phase/transition selectors are also excluded. Computer-assisted and parent-rechecked; arbitrary larger gap bounds remain open. |
| Any specified finite subsampling menu has a finite YES/NO decision certificate; an automatic selector suffices if any selector exists | [Focused descent synthesis](explorations/descent.md), [automata proof](explorations/descent-automata.md). State complexity depends on menu heights; no uniform five-menu exclusion. Parent-reviewed AI argument, not human certification. A separate independent checker excludes one specified five-menu with gaps up to 27, not the whole gap-27 class. |
| Fixed transition recoding cannot give 4D/5D | [Certificates](../../results/unit-step-dimension-probe.json), [independent validator](../../design/check_unit_step_dimension_results.py): all 1,701 onto four-label codings fail within 44 steps; all 1,050 five-label codings fail within 85 steps. Does not exclude context-dependent coding. |
| Shallit's five-letter candidate survives a finite prefix | [Result](../../results/shallit-five-prefix.json): 38,416 steps, 38,417 vertices, 737,913,736 exact chord checks. **Not an infinite 5D proof.** |
| Five-marker witnesses synchronize only at a common fraction | [Compatibility checkpoint](tracks/five-marker-compatibility/README.md): interval-Helly equivalence, bounded adjacent-swap/ternary defects, and the exact avoiding word `010213432340124`, whose ten pair-return fraction sets have empty intersection. Written AI-assisted arguments and independently coded finite checks; no universal forcing theorem, infinite avoiding extension, or changed minimum. |
| Naive substitution descent is incomplete | [Exact diagnostic](../../results/shallit-substitution-algebra.json), [derivation](../../design/UNIT-STEP-4D-5D-INVESTIGATION.md#exact-descent-available-so-far): 170 nonzero integral boundary corrections already for equal adjacent lengths. These are not 170 actual counterexamples. |
| Four-letter cube draft | [Review notes](../../design/WEAK-ABELIAN-CUBE-DRAFT-REVIEW.md), [bounded checker](../../design/check_weak_abelian_cube_draft.mjs), [result](checks/weak-abelian-cube.json): five substitution identities and displacement rows checked; 66,248 equal-state pairs tested. Preliminary audit, not full independent certification or a novelty claim. |

The [period-8 audit](../../results/signed-gaussian-unit-step-audit.json) is
preserved, and the [period-16 audit](checks/signed-gaussian-period-16.json) was
regenerated for this checkpoint because its earlier result was temporary.
Only the two alternating patterns reach six in those finite searches (rules 85
and 170 at period 8; indices 21845 and 43690 at period 16). The
six-dimensional PDF proves existence; **it does not contain the separate
no-5D-within-scheme argument**. Keep that earlier scope correction explicit.

A separate [higher-sign topology investigation](tracks/HIGHER-SIGN-TOPOLOGIES.md)
reduces state-only selectors over all infinite sign streams to 1,080 exact
cases. With fixed Cambie tags, completed computations also exclude at most
five vectors for nonempty, tail-state-dependent selections in blocks of
length 2, 4, 8, and 16. A second implementation confirms the 8-position case;
the 16-position case has not had a second full-size implementation check or
external review. These are restricted selector exclusions, **not** improved
global bounds or an all-block-size impossibility theorem. The note preserves
reproduction commands, tests, scoped results, and the superseded solver timeouts.

## 4. Construction data needed to resume

For $g_{85}$, use $\sigma(n)=\sum_j(-1)^j b_j(n)\pmod4$ and
$u_n=i^{\sigma(n)}$. The six spatial step types are

| Type | State transitions | Spatial vector |
|---|---|---|
| A | 01 | (1,0,5) |
| B | 12 | (0,3,5) |
| C | 23 | (-1,-2,5) |
| D | 30 | (0,-1,1) |
| E | 02,13 | (1,1,6) |
| F | 20,31 | (-1,-1,2) |

Rule 170 is the sign-reversed companion and gives the same dimension bound,
not literally the identical six spatial vectors. Rule 85 alone proves the
proposed existence result. The independent four-uniform transition generator
and its coding are in [the consequences note](../../design/UNIT-STEP-CONSEQUENCES.md).

Shallit's leading 5D candidate is

$$
 h(0)=01213101314310,\qquad h(r)=h(0)+r\pmod5
$$

letterwise, with fixed point starting at 0. For its incidence matrix $M$,
$F(14n)=MF(n)$, $\det M=14\cdot421$, and aligned triples descend. The missing
step is a proof covering partial blocks and **arbitrary unequal adjacent
lengths**, not a larger prefix scan. The candidate might still fail later.

## 5. Next proof-oriented work

The [September 8 uniform-certificate checkpoint](tracks/JOINT-CHECKPOINT.md)
preserves the full interval from gap ratio 49:51 through 51:49 and the
all-ratio uniform/missing-letter direction exclusions for Shallit's candidate.
These independently code-checked, outside-review-pending reductions are not a
complete basis construction or a fixed five-step 3D realization. The final
joint-goal subsampling audit stopped at the missing infinite-compatible menu
reduction. Neither minimum's bound changed and no ordered pair was eliminated.
The checkpoint indexes incomplete searches, known failed shortcuts, and the
separate CI validation/resume entry point; it does not schedule more research.

The subsequent [six-direction exploration](explorations/README.md) is complete:
all six independent agent reports received a parent proof review and fresh
checker runs. The requested [focused descent follow-up](explorations/descent.md)
also finished: three agents, four agent checkers and an independent fixed-menu
verifier. Naive menu-preserving coarsening is false even after choosing among
all four rounding offsets; finite witnesses do not refute an infinite-only
implication. Fixed-phase and height-gcd descents remain valid. The strongest
new theorem decides any specified finite menu and reduces arbitrary selectors
to 4-automatic selectors, without bounding their state count by menu size.

No numerical minimum bound changed. The next descent target is an
**infinite-extendability invariant** for the 16-height-residue correction
system, connected to the exact matrix certificates—not another blind gap or
prefix scan. A uniform zero-certificate theorem for all five-vector menus, or
one positive five-menu cycle, would settle the construction-specific target.
Other directions remain simultaneous two-marker constraints for five letters
and constructions outside the classified valuation/raw-iid methods. The reports
also give an odd-prime certificate obstruction and a spectral filter for
rational 3D projections. These are AI-assisted research results, not collaborator
approval. Shallit's candidate is not refuted; the now-archived fixed-ratio
progress is indexed in the exploration's prior-work ledger. Do not simply repeat the original four
handoffs without accounting for these results.

**Five-marker compatibility checkpoint (September 10, AI-assisted):** the
[archived word investigation](tracks/five-marker-compatibility/README.md)
sharpens the simultaneous-marker obligation: pair witnesses with common outer
cuts synchronize if and only if their attainable fractions have a common
value. Common outer cuts alone are insufficient, as the exactly checked
15-letter avoiding counterexample shows. At one fraction, nine successful
pairs can still leave one adjacent swap; eight leave a ternary bridge of at
most seven letters. These are structural lemmas, not a proof that dense
intersection graphs or a common fraction must occur in every infinite word.
The remaining target is common-fraction forcing across actual factors, with
all unequal lengths retained. Shallit's candidate and all minimum bounds are
unchanged. The report preserves proof scope, exact examples, resumable search
and verification, and CLI regressions; CI reruns the checks. Do not repeat the
refuted shortcut of combining separate pair returns at different fractions.

**Retired attempt (September 10, AI-assisted):** five-uniform square-Koch
compass recursions (`E -> E N E S E`, with rotated or reflected images) plus
a fifth vertical insertion step produced no infinite construction or new
global bound. The restricted negative findings did not justify further work.
Do not resume marker, height, or prefix scans without a genuinely new all-scale
triple-avoidance mechanism. Detailed reports, checkers, and run artifacts were
discarded at the user's request. This is a do-not-repeat checkpoint, not an
archived proof or a global impossibility claim.

For concurrent sessions, use the [bounded handoff operating rules](PARALLEL-TASKS.md).
Start each in a separate worktree from current `origin/main`; the four-core
resource limit is host-wide across sessions, not a per-session allowance.

1. **Vet and reconcile.** Independently check the 6D argument and audit the
   others with their authors. Use the [working synthesis](FRAMEWORK.md) to
   separate the shared valuation mechanism from the dimension bottleneck.
2. **Attack the exact minima.** Seek 4D/5D infinite constructions and general
   combinatorial obstructions, tracking their one-way consequences for 3D
   step count. For Shallit's candidate, target a certified all-ratios
   boundary-state descent, or an exact counterexample.
3. **Bridge only with explicit quantifiers.** A 3D integer projection with an
   infinite proof certifies both models. Prefix projections with unbounded
   coefficients do not suffice; a uniform bound would permit compactness.
   Equality of minima needs one optimal basis witness to project, not a
   classification of every walk or a universal 2-adic law.
4. **Do not repeat exhausted work.** Merely merging fixed g85 transitions has
   been exhaustively refuted. Any new reduction needs more than that coding.
5. **Keep an honest stopping/review checkpoint.** A sharp result is the ambition,
   not a guaranteed consequence of more AI searches. If the gap persists,
   distinguish a publishable synthesis from a complete optimality theorem.

## 6. Reproduction, limits, and preserved WIP

No Gmail access, private `/tmp` file, or prior chat is required to read and
recheck the archived PDFs and completed evidence. One editable attachment is
still missing, as explicitly recorded in the archive.

Quick archive and model checks (run from repository root):

```sh
node research/unit-step/check.mjs
node research/unit-step/joint_minimum_examples.mjs
node design/unit-step-explainer/test.mjs
node design/check_weak_abelian_cube_draft.mjs
```

Independently validate the saved dimension certificates and the C++ checker:

```sh
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
src=design/verify_unit_step_prefix.cpp
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic \
  -DSOURCE_SHA=\"$(sha256sum "$src" | cut -d' ' -f1)\" \
  "$src" -o /tmp/verify_unit_step_prefix
python3 design/check_unit_step_dimension_results.py --binary /tmp/verify_unit_step_prefix
```

The preserved period-16 audit can be regenerated independently:

```sh
python3 design/signed_gaussian_unit_step_audit.py --period 16 \
  --output research/unit-step/checks/signed-gaussian-period-16.json \
  --checkpoint .checkpoint-unit-step-period-16/state.json \
  --log .checkpoint-unit-step-period-16/run.jsonl
```

Full generation commands, resume semantics, and the larger 38,416-step run are
in [the investigation](../../design/UNIT-STEP-4D-5D-INVESTIGATION.md#4-reproduction-and-validation).
Do not rerun the large prefix by default: it cannot settle infinity. Checkpoints
and timestamped logs remain under ignored `.checkpoint-*` paths. Final evidence
is tracked separately. Enforce the repository's maximum **four aggregate CPU
cores**, and checkpoint all substantive Python work.

To regenerate searchable PDF text, using pinned extraction tooling:

```sh
uv run --with pypdf==6.17.0 python research/unit-step/extract_text.py
```

Extraction validates source hashes, atomically writes/checkpoints each PDF,
resumes compatible completed work, and rejects incompatible or corrupt state.
Text hashes are validated by `check.mjs`; inspect intentional extraction changes
rather than silently changing the immutable PDF hash.

The [interactive explainer](../../design/unit-step-explainer/README.md) includes
modular source, arithmetic/browser tests, and standalone offline HTML. It is
tracked research, not a production-site addition. Any LAN service uses root
`q5m.yaml` and the managed lifecycle; do not assume an old process or URL is alive.
The new research-only `results/` JSONs are explicitly excluded by `.dockerignore`.

The local investigation and explainer originated in commits
`0c667641d34a3ab6427d121f6640c0a44e0c013d` and
`bebc640e86903ab3c1186ec89cc197c033264034`, retained in this checkpoint branch.
Older work remains in Git history; do not replace it with a fabricated unified
proof. [All PDFs and provenance](../../paper/followups/README.md) remain indexed.
